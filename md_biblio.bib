  abstract         = {Nonrigid surface registration is a challenging problem that suffers from many ambiguities. Existing methods typically assume the availability of full volumetric data, or require a global model of the surface of interest. In this paper, we introduce an approach to nonrigid registration that performs on relatively low-quality RGBD images and does not assume prior knowledge of the global surface shape. To this end, we model the surface as a collection of patches, and infer the patch deformations by performing inference in a graphical model. Our representation lets us fill in the holes in the input depth maps, thus essentially achieving surface completion. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on several sequences, as well as its robustness to missing data and occlusions.},
